This Project has been one of my first - and at that time - most favorite projects. Back in the days i used to play WoW
quite frequently and I was quite into it, so this project got initiated.
Starting from Scratch, I began to create the HTML and CSS all by myself and switched to Bootstrap within the process.

Furthermore I uncluded some APIs (members, scores, etc.) and the site has been hosted at ms azure (for DB and stuff...)
The project never really finished in time, before the guild has been deleted... Plans has been to create a back end for the guild members,
a video section fetching videos from our yt channel and more...

yeah... 
good old time
