This project was one of my first, and at that time, one of my most favorite projects. Back in the day, I used to play WoW quite frequently, and I was deeply involved in it, which led to the initiation of this project. Starting from scratch, I began to create the HTML and CSS all by myself, and eventually switched to Bootstrap during the process.

Furthermore, I included some APIs (for members, scores, etc.), and the site was hosted on Microsoft Azure (for the database and other related functionalities). However, the project never really finished on time, as the guild was deleted before completion. Our plans were to create a backend for guild members, a video section that fetches videos from our YouTube channel, and more.

Ah, those were the good old times.
